The objects package provides an API that simplifies the usage of the entities in gsim. Entities are attribute-value containers within a schema hierarchy of 
such entities. They are maintained in the gsim environment. Entities can be either of type <code>Frame</code> or <code>Instance</code> and derive 
from <code>Unit</code>. The API interfaces abstract from this distinction where possible, and also takes care of the operations to perform on the environment.
